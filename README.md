# TransferCalls
The program that takes the CSV file and displays the mission transfer calls as HTML documents

To use, download the Excel file from the Transfer Board section in IMOS in the "submitted transfer senerio"

Add transfer instructions and make sure that the header looks identical to the example.
Download as a CSV file, and change the name to "transfer_data.csv"

Download all of this code, unzip it, then put the downloaded CSV file into the main folder (You'll probably have to delete the example/existing "transfer_data" CSV file)

Copy just downloaded CSV file contaning the updated information named "transfer_data.csv" into the root folder of this program (the same directory as this README file)

Exicute the "Build_Transfer_Calls.py" program, and hopefuly there are no errors

Outputed transfer calls are in the "Transfer Calls Output" folder
